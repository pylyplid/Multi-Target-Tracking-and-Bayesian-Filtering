# Multi-Target-Tracking-and-Bayesian-Filtering
This project explores simulation and tracking of multiple moving targets using Bayesian filtering techniques.  Implemented in Python using Kalman, PDA, IPDA, and PHD filters, with animated visualizations in Google Colab.

## 🧠 Features
- Multi-target simulation in 2D space
- Kalman Filtering for single-object tracking
- Probabilistic Data Association (PDA & IPDA)
- PHD Filter implementation
- Animated plots using matplotlib

## 📚 Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, SciPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
-
